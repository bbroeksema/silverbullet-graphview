# SilverBullet plug for showing a graph view of the documents

This plug aims to bring similar functionality as the Obsidian Graph view to
Silver Bullet.

## Installation

Open (`cmd+k`) your `PLUGS` note in SilverBullet and add this plug to the list:

```yaml
- github:bbroeksema/silverbullet-graphview/graphview.plug.js
```

Then run the `Plugs: Update` command and off you go!

## Usage

Run the `Show Global Graph` command to open up the graph view. Zoom and pan is
supported by scroll and pinch gestures with the mouse(pad).

### Tags & Paths
Set **tags** on the pages to customize their appearance in the graph
- `#node_color=ff0000` â†’ Change node color to red
- `#.graphignore` â†’ Hide the page from the graph

You can also use other custom tags to define node colors:
Create a colormap with HEX-colorcodes in `SETTINGS.md`. In this example, a node of a page where the tag `#garden` is set will be rendered as green:
```yaml
# Graphview
graphview:
  default_color: "000000"
  colormap:
    path:
      âš™ services: "01017a"
      ðŸ““ notes: "02bdb6"
      ðŸš§ projects: "ffc533"
      ðŸ§° how-to: "96020e"
    tag:
      garden: "0bbd02"
```
## Links
Click on the node labels to directly navigate to pages in your space

## Label-shortening
Long labels are shortened for readability.
E.g. `notesarecool/somethingverylong/subsubsubsub/foo` â†’ `notes./somet./subsu./foo`

## For offline development

To ease development of the visual part, the offline folder contains a copy of
the html and custom javascript. As well as a simple graph model.

```bash
$ cd offline
$ python -m http.server
```
